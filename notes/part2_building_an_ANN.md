# Building an ANN

## Example: Churn Modeling

## Libraries

* Theano
* Tensorflow
* Keras

## Improving the ANN

* Dropout Regularization
  * Solution for overtraining, when the ANN learned too much on training set, succeeds on models of some test sets due to correlation similarities.
  * At each iteration of training, some neurons are randomly disabled to prvent overtraining
